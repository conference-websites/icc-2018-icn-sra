Internet communication has evolved from the end-to-end model represented by applications like telnet and towards the content distribution model represented by applications like video streaming and file sharing. Such dramatic shift is particularly challenging to the existing IP model given the mismatch between its host-centric approach to networking and the content-centric approach embraced by today’s applications. The recently emerged Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm and its most prominent realization Named Data Networking (NDN) provide an efficient communication model for today’s and future applications.  Within the last few years, ICN/NDN has evolved from the basic research phase and into the applied research phase to address real world problems including industrial control systems, scientific applications, as well as tactical network environments.  The core building blocks of ICN/NDN provide features such as application-defined hierarchical naming, built-in security, stateful forwarding (which enables network intelligence and packet loop suppression), in-network caching, and organic multicast support. These ICN/NDN features enable more efficient communication, better resilience to challenging network dynamics, and improved latency and data delivery.

The objective of this workshop is to highlight recent research, development, and evaluation of ICN/NDN in real world applications as well as stimulate more discussions in this area.  The workshop has a particular interest in real world applications of ICN/NDN in challenging communication environments, where IP-based solutions are excessively complex or simply do not work.  This workshop will offer a venue for researchers from both industry and academia to demonstrate their recent progress in applying ICN/NDN in this problem space as well as identify potential opportunities and research gaps.
