=========================================================

Mobility support facing unprecedented challenges due to ever
increasing number of mobile devices at global scale, ever increasing
ranges of diversity of these devices, and ever increasing demand of
both data volumes and security requirements by these devices; these
challenges demand a new exploration of supporting
architecture. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a promising
direction to transition towards the data-oriented communication with
one of the research focus targeting specifically mobile and wireless
environments. In recent years, ICN is attracting a widespread interest
from academia and industry, with involvements from industry forums,
and consortiums. Instead of host-to-host communication model, as in
the current Internet architecture, named-oriented networking shifts
communication towards a data-centric model that focuses on retrieving
named and secured data, instead of host-to-host connections. ICN
secures named data directly, giving it an advantage over current
Internet solutions that only secure the communication channels between
hosts, a mismatch for wireless and mobile networks. Furthermore, ICN's
data-centricity (i.e., independence of specific attachment points in
the underlying networks) makes it a promising direction for 5G
networks which aim to utilizes multiple radios nodes with connectivity
across multiple radio technologies.

Name-oriented networking offers a new mobility network paradigm to
meet mobile device characters and mobile data routing, processing,
storage, and retrieval. Thanks to its native design based on data
naming (request for data forwarded based on data's names and data is
returned using the reverse path of the request), name-oriented
networking enables user and devices mobility across multiple radio
technologies and is a good candidate for mobile/wireless networks,
including 5G networks. In addition, ICN technology is promising in
offering a scalable networking layer for IoT applications, including
massive sensor devices that suffer from the lack of mobility
management in the IP architecture and the lack an efficient storage,
security, and sharing means.

We encourage submission of original technical contributions on, but
not limited to, the following:

- ICN mobile/wireless architectures and platforms Mobile Applications
  and services for ICN
- IoT with ICN use-cases

- ICN for Big Data storage and retrieval
- ICN in social networks applications
- ICN scalability to massive mobile/IoT devices
- Comparison and evaluation of ICN vs IP for IoT
- Analytic model of ICN-based mobile network
- ICN for mobile edge/core mobile network
- ICN support for seamless/simultaneous connectivity across
  heterogeneous radio technologies ICN solutions for delay/disruption
  tolerance in wireless and mobile networks
- Policy management with ICN
- Data naming and Objects Identification in mobile network/IoT
- Context-awareness and Big data
