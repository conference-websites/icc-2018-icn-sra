The Internet communication has evolved from the end-to-end model represented by applications like telnet toward the content distribution model represented by applications like video streaming and file sharing. Such dramatic shift is particularly challenging to the existing IP model given the mismatch between its host-centric approach to networking and the content-centric approach embraced by today’s applications. The recently emerged Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm addresses this mismatch and provides efficient communication model for today’s and future applications.  Within a last few years, the ICN/NDN has evolved from the basic research phase and into the applied research phase to address real world problems including industrial control systems, scientific applications, as well as tactical network environments.  The core building block of ICN/NDN provides features required by today’s applications including the application-defined, hierarchically named, and secured network-level packets, the stateful forwarding that enables network intelligence, packet loop suppressing, in-network caching, and data multicast.  These features of ICN/NDN allow a more efficient communication, better resilience to challenging network dynamics, and improved latency and data delivery.  

The objective of this workshop is to highlight recent research, development, and evaluation of ICN/NDN in real world application as well as stimulate more discussions in that area.  The workshop has a particular interest in real world application of ICN/NDN in challenging communication environments, where IP-based solution are excessively complex or simply do not work.  This workshop will offer a venue for researchers from both industry and academia to demonstrate their recent progresses in applying ICN/NDN in this problem space as well as identify potential opportunities and research gaps.
